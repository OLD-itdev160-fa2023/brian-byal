    <h1>Unlocking the natural highways of the brain.</h1>

    <h2><b>Introducing Neuro EP</b></h2>

    <p>
        One thing about me is am fascinated by science and technology, especially new advancements made in the medical field.
        Similar to Elon Musk's Neuralink, a BCI (brain-computer interface) competitor by the name of Synchron
        has developed the world’s first FDA-approval for clinical trials, which I find entirely fascinating.
        Philip O’Keefe, i.e. patient one, had his implant integrated in 2020 as part of the first clinical trial.
        By 2021, Philip was the first individual in the world to post on social media using direct thought.

        The technology is an endovascular BCI that can access every corner of the brain using its natural highways, the blood vessels.
        Synchron’s breakthrough platform has launched a new frontier for the treatment of neurological diseases and is entirely non-invasive unlike Neuralink.
        Synchron’s technology will transform three medical verticals we see today:
